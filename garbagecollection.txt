Garbage collections

If we create a object like this,

let obj = {
    name: "javascript"
}

here the variable obj not stored the object value its stored the object reference.  That means the object {name: "javascript"} is stored in someother place in the system memory.
And we are storing that memory address in the variable obj.  This is how object works. So if the object is created and refered by some refered by someother variable only the object 
will alive.  

Consider,
if I created a obj above if I remove the object reference in the variable

obj = null;

So that object referenced not stored in the variable that means we can't able to access that object.  In this scenario to prevent the unwanted storage js engine will remove that 
object from the memory.  Its called garbage collections.
